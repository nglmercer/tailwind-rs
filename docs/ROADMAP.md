# Roadmap

The roadmap is organized around compiler risk, not marketing features.

## Phase 0 — Foundation

Goal: establish workspace, architecture, invariants, CI, benchmarks, and minimal IR.

Exit criteria:

- Cargo workspace exists.
- Core dependency direction is enforced.
- Formatting/lint/test CI passes.
- Benchmark harness exists.
- Error type and source span conventions exist.

See `roadmap/PHASE_0_FOUNDATION.md`.

## Phase 1 — Scanner + DSL parser

Goal: reliably discover and parse static utility candidates.

Exit criteria:

- text scanner works on representative HTML/JSX/TSX/Vue/Svelte-like input,
- escape rules are defined,
- candidate AST is stable enough for semantic work,
- fuzzing exists for parser/scanner boundaries.

See `roadmap/PHASE_1_SCANNER_PARSER.md`.

## Phase 2 — Utility compiler

Goal: compile a useful utility subset to deterministic CSS.

Initial families:

- display,
- spacing,
- sizing,
- color,
- border radius,
- typography subset,
- grid/flex subset.

Exit criteria:

- theme resolution works,
- deterministic ordering works,
- arbitrary values work for approved grammars,
- utility registry API is established.

See `roadmap/PHASE_2_UTILITY_COMPILER.md`.

## Phase 3 — Variants + incremental engine

Goal: support state/responsive variants and fast rebuilds.

Initial variants:

- hover,
- focus,
- active,
- disabled,
- dark,
- responsive breakpoints,
- group/peer subset.

Exit criteria:

- variant composition rules are specified,
- file-to-candidate diffing works,
- unchanged candidates are not recompiled,
- watch benchmark suite exists.

See `roadmap/PHASE_3_VARIANTS_INCREMENTAL.md`.

## Phase 4 — Native CLI + JS bindings

Goal: expose stable compiler behavior to native and JS runtimes.

Deliverables:

- CLI,
- N-API package for Node/Bun,
- WASM package where useful,
- stable serialization protocol.

See `roadmap/PHASE_4_BINDINGS_CLI.md`.

## Phase 5 — Vite + runtime adapters

Goal: make integration excellent.

Deliverables:

- Vite plugin,
- Node API,
- Bun-tested compatibility,
- Deno integration path,
- file invalidation bridge,
- dev/prod behavior parity.

See `roadmap/PHASE_5_ADAPTERS.md`.

## Phase 6 — Smart extraction + ecosystem

Goal: add optional AST-assisted extraction and extension points.

Delivered in the current production-readiness increment:

- SWC-assisted extractor,
- Vue/Svelte/Astro framework-specific static extractors,
- declarative utility/variant plugin descriptions,
- IDE/LSP diagnostics, completion, and hover services,
- explicitly scoped compatibility presets.

Remaining release work is broader compatibility coverage, workspace-aware IDE configuration, and
platform/package release verification. These MUST be accompanied by conformance fixtures before
being advertised as stable.

See `roadmap/PHASE_6_ECOSYSTEM.md`.

## Release milestones

Suggested:

- `0.1` — scanner/parser experimental,
- `0.2` — basic utilities,
- `0.3` — variants + incremental,
- `0.4` — CLI/bindings,
- `0.5` — Vite integration,
- `0.6+` — ecosystem hardening,
- `1.0` — grammar/API stability commitment.

## Feature gate policy

Experimental behavior should be behind explicit feature flags or unstable APIs until its semantics are documented.
